issues:
  - |
    libnetfilter_log, which is required in neutron-l3-agent when fwaas_v2_log
    is enabled, is not available in official rpm repos and enabling this
    feature on rpm platforms will prevent neutron-l3-agent from running.
fixes:
  - |
    libnnetfilter_log has been added to deb platforms in order to support
    the fwaas_v2_log feature in neutron l3 agent.
