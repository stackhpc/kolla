features:

    Updated the contents of Python package options in documentation to reflect
    latest customisation methods.
upgrade:
  - |
    The use of ``UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE`` environment variable was moved from
    ``base_pip_conf`` block in base Dockerfile to ``kolla_toolbox_pip_conf``
    block in kolla-toolbox Dockerfile as the environment variable now only
    affects Kolla-toolbox build.
    Bifrost python upper-constraints now follows openstack-base's
    python upper-constraints instead of ``UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE`` environment
    variable.
