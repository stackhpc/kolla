    Adds aarch64 iPXE support to the ironic-pxe image, by adding
    ``ipxe-bootimgs-aarch64`` RPM package to Rocky Linux ironic-pxe
    images, and ensuring that an aarch64 iPXE binary is available
    in Ubuntu ironic-pxe images. No support for aarch64 iPXE in
    Debian images is included, as the distro packages do not
    install an aarch64 binary.
